<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>

<br><h3>Name: Daisy Cho</h3></br>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The web site should produce an increase of customers of at least 50%. Volleyball is a great family sport, so we think more young families would enjoy being part of what we offer – volleyball (including professional competitions sometimes), socialising, licensed bar (happy hour every day from 6-7pm), available to hire for functions – fun and fitness.
We get players of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience, getting kids playing while they’re in high school (15 – 30). We think more people would play and come and watch competitions if they knew about us more.
</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>The success of the web site will be measured by the number of customers that sign up on the web page.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Younger audience between the ages 15 to 30. Preferrably starting in high school.</p>
