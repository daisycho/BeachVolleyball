<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>

<br><h3>Name: Daisy Cho</h3></br>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The website is intended to increase the number of customers by at least 50% for Slammers Beach Volleyball by promoting services that appeals to an younger audience and services that may peak the interest of the visitors in order to get people to sign up to play online. This site should also appeal to a younger audience, getting kids playing while they’re in high school (15 – 30). 
</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>The success of the web site will be measured by looking at the number of current customers (<em>c</em>), before the website, and see if there are <em>c + 0.5*c</em> customers by next season, August 21. Also, we will be comparing the percentage between the current number of 15 to 30 years old (<em>h</em>) out of all the customers (<em>c</em>), <em>h/c</em>, and the number of 15 to 30 year olds (<em>h1</em>) out of all customers at August 21 (<em>c1</em>), <em>h1/c1 *100</em>.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>Younger audience between the ages 15 to 30. In order to cater to the tastes of a younger audience, I used brighter colors and made it much more simple to look at with emphasis on a few points that may attract younger people. The website is influenced by many online shopping sites that are popular amongst those in their teens and 20s.</p>
